## 1\. Project Overview

The Todo List application is designed as a microservices-based system. It comprises:

  * **`api-gateway`**: A Go service exposing a RESTful API for the frontend, communicating with the storage service via gRPC.
  * **`storage-service`**: A Go microservice responsible for data persistence using SQLite, exposing a gRPC API.
  * **`proto`**: A shared directory defining the gRPC contracts.

## 3\. Core Architectural Concepts & Implementation Details

### 3.1. Microservices Architecture

  * **Implementation:** The application is split into two distinct Go services: `api-gateway` and `storage-service`.
  * **Why:**
      * **Scalability:** Allows independent scaling of each service based on its specific load. For example, if API requests are high but storage operations are low, only the API Gateway needs more instances.
      * **Fault Isolation:** A failure in one service (e.g., storage) is less likely to bring down the entire application immediately.
      * **Modularity:** Promotes clear separation of concerns, making development, testing, and deployment of individual components easier.
      * **Technology Flexibility:** While both services are in Go here, this pattern allows different technologies to be used for different services if optimal (e.g., Python for ML, Node.js for real-time).

### 3.2. gRPC Communication

  * **Implementation:**
      * Defined service and message structures in `proto/task_service.proto`.
      * Used `protoc` to auto-generate Go client and server code (`.pb.go` files).
      * `api-gateway` acts as a gRPC client using `github.com/sahidhossen/todo/api-gateway/internal/services/task_client.go`.
      * `storage-service` implements the gRPC server using `github.com/sahidhossen/todo/storage-service/internal/services/task_service.go`.
  * **Why:**
      * **Performance:** gRPC, built on HTTP/2 and using binary Protocol Buffers, offers lower latency and higher throughput compared to traditional REST/JSON for inter-service communication.
      * **Strong Contracts:** `.proto` files serve as a strict Interface Definition Language (IDL), ensuring clear, versioned API contracts between services. This prevents many integration bugs and simplifies client generation across different languages.
      * **Type Safety:** Auto-generated code provides compile-time type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience.

### 3.3. Data Persistence (SQLite)

  * **Implementation:**
      * `storage-service` uses SQLite as its persistent data store.
      * The `internal/store/store.go` defines the `Store` interface, and `internal/store/sqlite/sqlite.go` provides the concrete SQLite implementation.
      * Database schema creation (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) is handled on service startup.
  * **Why:**
      * **Persistence:** Moves beyond volatile in-memory storage, ensuring data survives service restarts.
      * **Simplicity:** SQLite is a lightweight, embedded database, ideal for development and single-instance microservices without the overhead of a separate database server.
      * **Transactional Guarantees:** Provides ACID properties for reliable data operations.

### 3.4. Robust Error Handling

  * **Implementation:**
      * **Custom Domain Errors:** Defined custom errors like `domain.ErrNotFound`, `domain.ErrInvalidInput` in `internal/domain/errors.go`.
      * **gRPC Status Mapping:** In `storage-service/internal/services/task_service.go`, internal errors (including `domain.ErrNotFound`) are mapped to appropriate gRPC `codes` (e.g., `codes.NotFound`, `codes.InvalidArgument`, `codes.Internal`).
      * **API Gateway Error Mapping:** In `api-gateway/internal/services/task_client.go`, gRPC errors from the storage service are mapped back to `api-gateway`'s `domain` errors.
      * **Standardized HTTP Responses:** `api-gateway/internal/httputil/response.go` provides `WriteJSON` for consistent JSON error responses, and `api-gateway/internal/handlers/handlers.go` includes `handleServiceError` to map domain errors to HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500).
  * **Why:**
      * **Predictability:** Ensures clients receive consistent and understandable error messages and status codes.
      * **Debugging:** Clear error messages and gRPC codes aid in tracing failures across service boundaries.
      * **User Experience:** Provides meaningful feedback to the frontend.

### 3.5. Structured & Contextual Logging

  * **Implementation:**
      * Both Go services use `log/slog` for structured logging.
      * Log messages include key-value pairs (e.g., `error`, `id`, `method`, `path`).
      * A custom `NopHandler` and `NewNopLogger()` are implemented in `internal/testutil/logger.go` for silent test runs.
  * **Why:**
      * **Observability:** Structured logs are machine-readable, making them easy to parse, filter, and analyze in centralized logging systems (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki).
      * **Debugging Efficiency:** Rich context in logs (e.g., request IDs, specific error details) significantly speeds up troubleshooting in production.
      * **Maintainability:** Consistent logging format across services.
      * **Clean Tests:** Prevents log clutter during automated test runs.

### 3.6. Configuration Management

  * **Implementation:** Services are configured via environment variables (e.g., `STORAGE_GRPC_ADDR`, `HTTP_PORT`).
  * **Why:**
      * **Flexibility:** Allows easy configuration changes between development, testing, and production environments without modifying code.
      * **Security:** Keeps sensitive information out of source code.

### 3.7. Graceful Shutdown

  * **Implementation:** Both `api-gateway` and `storage-service` implement graceful shutdown mechanisms. They listen for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals and allow a timeout period for active requests to complete before shutting down.
  * **Why:**
      * **Reliability:** Prevents abrupt termination, reducing the chance of data corruption or dropped requests during deployments or scaling events.
      * **Improved Availability:** Contributes to smoother service restarts and updates.

### 3.8. Input Validation

  * **Implementation:** Basic input validation (e.g., checking for empty `title` or `id`) is performed at the API Gateway and Storage Service layers.
  * **Why:**
      * **Data Integrity:** Prevents invalid or incomplete data from reaching deeper layers of the application or the database.
      * **Security:** A first line of defense against malicious or malformed inputs.
      * **Efficiency:** Fails fast on bad requests, saving downstream processing.

### 3.9. Concurrency Safety (Storage Service)

  * **Implementation:** SQLite handles many concurrency aspects internally (e.g., locking at the database level). Application-level concurrency concerns (like `sync.RWMutex` for in-memory stores) would be managed if an in-memory solution were still in use.
  * **Why:**
      * **Data Consistency:** Ensures that concurrent read/write operations do not corrupt data.
      * **Reliability:** Prevents race conditions.

### 3.10. Comprehensive Unit Testing

  * **Implementation:**
      * Dedicated `_test.go` files for `handlers`, `grpc_client`, and `task_service` packages.
      * Extensive use of `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock` to create mock implementations of interfaces (`store.Store`, `services.TaskService`).
      * Tests cover success, invalid input, and various error scenarios.
      * **Key Learning:** Mocks were designed to simulate *side effects* (e.g., `MockStore.SaveTask` assigning an ID to the `domain.Task` object passed by reference), accurately reflecting real dependency behavior.
  * **Why:**
      * **Isolation:** Tests individual components in isolation, making failures easy to diagnose.
      * **Speed:** Unit tests run very quickly, providing rapid feedback during development.
      * **Regression Prevention:** Catches bugs introduced by new changes.
      * **Design Validation:** Encourages good interface design and dependency injection.

## 4\. Future Improvements (Roadmap to Production Readiness)

While the current setup provides a strong foundation, a truly production-ready application requires further investment in these areas:

  * **Advanced Observability:**
      * **Metrics:** Instrument services with Prometheus metrics (request rates, latencies, error rates, resource utilization) and visualize with Grafana.
      * **Distributed Tracing:** Implement OpenTelemetry/Jaeger to trace requests across `api-gateway` and `storage-service` for end-to-end visibility.
      * **Centralized Logging:** Integrate with a robust logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki) for aggregation, alerting, and long-term storage.
  * **Enhanced Security:**
      * **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT) at the API Gateway and fine-grained authorization (RBAC) within services.
      * **TLS for gRPC:** Use TLS for gRPC communication between `api-gateway` and `storage-service` in production.
      * **Secrets Management:** Securely manage sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys) using dedicated tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
  * **Production-Grade Database:**
      * **Transition to Client-Server DB:** For high-concurrency and scalability, migrate from SQLite to a dedicated database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
      * **Database Migrations:** Implement a version-controlled database migration tool (e.g., `golang-migrate/migrate`) for schema changes.
  * **Deployment & Operations:**
      * **Container Orchestration:** Deploy services using Kubernetes or similar platforms for automated scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates.
      * **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate the entire build, test, and deployment process.
      * **Health Checks:** Implement dedicated `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints for orchestrators.
  * **Performance Optimization:**
      * **Benchmarking & Profiling:** Conduct systematic performance analysis to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
      * **Load Testing:** Simulate production load to understand system capacity and behavior under stress.
  * **API Versioning:**
      * **Strategy:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`) to manage backward compatibility as the API evolves.
  * **Comprehensive Documentation:**
      * **API Docs:** Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the REST API.
      * **Code & Architecture Docs:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for code, architecture decisions, and operational procedures.
